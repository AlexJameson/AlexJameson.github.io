В ней я упомянул, что можно создать GitHub Action для запуска CSpell в рамках CI-пайплайна. В тот момент у меня было только примерное понимание того, как такой Action должен работать, а в продакшене финальный вариант писали уже наши программисты с нуля.\nЯ решил доделать Action самостоятельно, чтобы дать любому пользователю возможность запускать CSpell в том числе в пул-реквестах на GitHub.\nТребования и ограничения\n\n\nОсновным требованием для этого процесса была возможность запуска CSpell с использованием того же конфигурационного файла и тех же словарей, которые могут использоваться локально.\n\n\nCSpell должен запускаться по команде в комментарии, оставленном в пул-реквесте.\n\n\nПроверяться должны те файлы, которые были изменены в пул-реквесте.\n\n\nПоследний пункт несет в себе ограничение, связанное со спецификой работы CSpell. Этот инструмент умеет проверять только файлы целиком, а не отдельные строки. Таким образом, при конфигурации нужно сделать выбор: либо проверять все файлы, в которых есть измененные строки, либо же собрать все измененные в коммитах строки в один временный файл, и проверить уже его. Я сделал выбор в пользу проверки реально существующих файлов, даже с учетом того, что в результатах проверки могут быть ошибки, которые появились не в рамках текущего пул-реквеста. Также у выбранного мной способа есть дополнительное преимущество — при проверке таких файлов будет указана строка, на которой есть слово, содержащее ошибку.\nРеализация\nГлавный вызов в создании Action такого рода заключается в правильном вычислении дельты (diff) между HEAD текущей ветки и HEAD ветки, в которую должен быть вмержен пул-реквест (base branch). На маркетплейсе GitHub есть Actions, которые должны позволять это делать, но ни один из них не сработал в моих условиях, так что я взял за основу код, предложенный Claude Sonnet 3.7, и доработал его под свою задачу.\nВ моей реализации Action работает следующим образом:\n\n\nВ первых четырех шагах (начиная с Checkout repository до Install Russian dictionary) в коде ниже происходит подготовка репозитория и установка всех необходимых пакетов в раннере.\n\n\nНа шаге Fetch PR details вычисляется дельта между HEAD текущей ветки и HEAD ветки, в которую должен быть вмержен пул-реквест.\n\n\nВ следующих шагах — Checkout PR и Get changed files — подготавливаются файлы, попадающие в вычисленную дельту.\n\n\nШаг Run CSpell check отвечает непосредственно за запуск проверки орфографии в этих файлах. Также на этом шаге подготавливается контент комментария, который будет отправлен в пул-реквест по окончанию проверки. В этом комментарии будет один из трех возможных результатов:\n\nОбнаружены ошибки. В таком случае в комментарии будут отправлены ошибки, которые были найдены в процессе проверки.\nПроверка прошла успешно. В таком случае в комментарии будет отправлен текст ✅ Spelling check passed for all changed files.\nНе обнаружены файлы, подлежащие проверке. В таком случае в комментарии будет отправлен текст ✅ No files changed to check..\n\nВ данном случае не предусмотрена обработка ошибок, возникающих в ходе запуска Action. Такие ошибки могут быть связаны с неверной конфигурацией, исчерпанием лимита бесплатного времени работы (2000 минут в месяц) и пр.\n\n\nПоследний шаг — Comment PR — отправляет комментарий с результатами в пул-реквест.\n\n\nПример проверки:\n\nПолучившийся файл расположен по адресу .github/workflows/cspell-check.yml и выглядит следующим образом:\n\nКонфигурация CSpell\nМоя собственная конфигурация CSpell с используемыми словарями подробно описана в статье, на которую я уже ссылался. Здесь я покажу только конфигурационный файл для тестового проекта:\n\n","description":"","id":"https://alexjameson.github.io/articles/cspell-github-action/","path":"/articles/cspell-github-action/","title":"GitHub Action для запуска CSpell в CI"},"https://alexjameson.github.io/articles/http-api-quickstart/":{"body":"Ключевой процесс в веб-разработке — это обмен данными через сеть. Практически любое взаимодействие в IT-системах — от просмотра страницы до развертывания приложения — строится на одном и том же: клиент запрашивает данные → сервер отвечает → клиент обрабатывает и отображает данные.\nВ серии статей мы пошагово разберём этот процесс, чтобы вы не просто видели результат, а понимали, что происходит на каждом этапе. Понимание этих процессов важно для технического писателя, который работает с продуктами для разработчиков, облачными сервисами или платформенными решениями.\nЯ буду ссылаться на теоретические материалы из журнала Код, принадлежащего Яндекс Практикуму. В статьях из этого цикла делается упор на практику, а ссылки на внешние материалы помогут получить необходимый контекст. Вы можете ознакомиться с соответствующей теорией на любом ресурсе по вашему выбору, «Код» выбран исключительно из соображений удобства.\nВ серии будет три статьи, в которых разберем следующее:\n\n→ Увидим, как устроено клиент-серверное взаимодействие;\nПонаблюдаем за тем, как браузер получает и отображает данные, а также изучим структуру веб-страниц;\nРазвернем собственный локальный сервер, чтобы почувствовать, как работает веб изнутри.\n\nВ первой статье мы познакомимся с основой основ — запросом к HTTP API и ответом сервера. HTTP до сих пор остаётся самым популярным протоколом для клиент-серверного взаимодействия, и понимание его работы поможет разобраться по аналогии с любым другим протоколом.\nИспользовать будем curl — простую, но мощную утилиту, доступную в любом терминале. Важно понимать: curl — это лишь один из способов. То же самое можно сделать через Postman или любой другой HTTP-клиент. Механика взаимодействия остаётся одной и той же, независимо от инструмента.\nТеория: знакомство с HTTP API\nПеред тем как вы приступите к теории, запомните: какие-то части могут показаться слишком сложными и их, скорее всего, можно пропустить, чтобы вернуться к ним в будущем. Не стесняйтесь переходить к практике, если теория не дается.\nAPI (Application Programming Interface) — это контракт, определяющий, как одно приложение может взаимодействовать с другим. В контракте зафиксированы основные параметры: доступные методы, форматы запросов и ответов, аутентификация.\nHTTP API — это интерфейс, использующий протокол HTTP/HTTPS для передачи данных.\nДанные передаются в формате JSON или XML. В данном цикле статей будет рассмотрен JSON.\nЧаще всего HTTP API соответствует стилю REST, где ресурсы доступны по URL, а действия над ними выполняются через HTTP-методы.\nЗапрос и ответ сервера можно визуализировать следующим образом:\n\n\n\n\nПодробнее:\n\nЧто такое API\nЧто такое протокол\nЧто такое формат JSON и как с ним работать\n\n\nREST\nREST (Representational State Transfer) — это архитектурный стиль, описывающий набор принципов построения API. В большинстве случаев HTTP API создается как RESTful API, но эти понятия не синонимичны.\nПринципы REST достаточно просты и их немного, я выделю наиболее важные на первом знакомстве:\n\nКлиент и сервер независимы, общаются через API\nОтсутствие состояния: Каждый запрос содержит всю необходимую информацию. Сервер не хранит состояние сессии.\nЕдинообразие: API организован по ресурсам, с API работают с помощью стандартных HTTP-методов.\n\nКлиент — это любая система или приложение, которое отправляет HTTP-запросы к серверу и использует его API. Это может быть браузер, сервер, мобильное приложение или любой другой инструмент, как управляемый напрямую человеком, так и нет.\nРесурсы — это любые сущности, например пользователи, посты или комментарии. К ним обращаются по соответствующим URL, например api.example.com/users/1.\n\nПодробнее:\n\nКак устроены API: разбираемся на примере REST API\n\n\nСтруктура запроса\nНиже показана структура HTTP-запроса. Именно так он выглядит для самого протокола, но не все поля этого запроса нужны всегда, а в разных клиентах некоторые поля можно не заполнять. Например, в curl запрос без указанного метода будет считаться GET-запросом.\n\n\nМетод и путь. Пример: GET /api/v1/users\n\n\nЗаголовки (Headers)\n\n\n\nHost: адрес хоста и, опционально, номер порта;\nContent-Type: тип данных в теле запроса (application/json);\nAuthorization: токен доступа;\nAccept: какие форматы ответа ожидает клиент;\n\n\nТело (Body) — только для методов, предполагающих отправку данных (POST, PUT, PATCH). Пример: { \"name\": \"Иван\", \"email\": \"ivan@example.com\" }\n\nМетоды\nСледующие методы по умолчанию используются для действий с ресурсами в HTTP API:\n\n\nGET: Получение ресурса. Не должен менять состояние ресурса;\n\n\nPOST: Создание нового ресурса;\n\n\nPUT: Полное обновление ресурса;\n\n\nPATCH: Частичное обновление;\n\n\nDELETE Удаление ресурса.\n\n\nПрактика: получаем и передаем данные\nНастройка окружения\nЭта статья предполагает работу с curl в терминале с поддержкой оболочки Bash.\nНа Windows я рекомендую использовать Git Bash, который устанавливается вместе с Git for Windows. Если у вас есть другой предпочитаемый терминал, который поддерживает Bash, можно использовать его. Работа в PowerShell технически возможно, но это не рекомендуемый вариант.\nНа других операционных системах можно пользоваться любым встроенным терминалом, так как в UNIX-подобных системах Bash поддержан по умолчанию.\nВыбор API\nВ качестве провайдера API будет использован сервис JSONPlaceholder. Это сервис, который предоставляет эмулятор API (mock API). В GET-запросах он отдает настоящие данные, а при POST-запросах он эмулирует ответ, аналогичный реальному ответу сервера. Из этого следует, что в этом API нельзя на самом деле модицифировать или удалять ресурсы, так что рассмотрены будут только GET- и POST-запросы.\nАутентификация в этом API не предусмотрена.\nК сожалению, документация и API сервиса периодически не доступны на территории России, но я верю, что при желании вы сможете решить эту проблему. Это будет полезно само по себе, но в сценариях ниже я привожу всю необходимую информацию для работы с этим API.\nJSONPlaceholder имеет 6 ресурсов:\nРесурсПутьКоличество\nПосты/posts100\nКомментарии/comments500\nАльбомы/albums100\nФото/photos5000\nЗадачи/todos200\nПользователи/users10\n\nСсылка на первый пост выглядит так: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1. Ссылка на комментарий с номером 500 выглядит так: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments/500.\nGET-запросы\nРассмотрим разные сценарии получения и обработки данных.\nПолучение состояния ресурса\nВ первом запросе проверяем состояние самого сервера. Это будет GET-запрос, хотя явно в curl это не указывается. Также не указывается большинство других частей запроса, которые разбирались в соответствующей секции.\nДля проверки статуса используется флаг -I, который запрашивает только заголовки HTTP-ответа и не скачивает тело запроса:\n\nНачало ответа должно выглядеть следующим образом:\n\nКод 200 в первой строке говорит о том, что запрос выполнен успешно.\nДалее попробуем получить состояние заведомо недоступного ресурса:\n\nСервер принял запрос, но вернул другой ответ:\n\nКод 404 говорит об отсутствии запрашиваемого ресурса на сервере.\n\nПодробнее:\n\nПочему иногда вместо сайтов мы видим разные ошибки сервера\n\n\nПолучение данных\nОтправляем GET-запрос к JSONPlaceholder для получения содержимого поста с id=1:\n\nОжидаемый ответ с содержимым поста, не несущим особой смысловой нагрузки:\n\nСтоит также отправить запросы к другим ресурсам. Можно выбрать любые ресурсы в том диапазоне, который был указан в таблице выше.\nНапример:\n\nИнформации о пользователях намного больше:\n\nРекомендую запросить аналогичным образом ресурсы всех типов.\nРабота с вложенными ресурсами\nJSONPlaceholder поддерживает иерархические маршруты, отражающие связи между ресурсами.\n\nУ постов есть комментарии, доступные по следующему пути: /posts/&lt;номер&gt;/comments.\nВ альбомах есть фотографии: /albums/&lt;номер&gt;/photos.\nУ пользователей есть альбомы, задачи и посты:\n\n/users/&lt;номер&gt;/albums;\n/users/&lt;номер&gt;/todos;\n/users/&lt;номер&gt;/posts.\n\n\n\nПопробуем запросить не просто отдельный ресурс, а все комментарии к посту 42:\n\nОтвет будет выглядеть как массив с объектами, начинающийся так:\n\nДалее проверим более сложное сочетание —&nbsp;сначала получим список всех альбомов пользователя, а потом посмотрим, какие фотографии принадлежат этому пользователю:\n\nВ ответе будет множество альбомов этого пользователя. id в данном случае — это идентификатор альбома:\n\nЗная, что пользователю принадлежит альбом с id=21, запросим фотографии из этого альбома:\n\nПолучим массив фотографий, начинающийся так:\n\n\nВ последнем примере пришлось сделать два отдельных запроса, чтобы получить один из наборов фотографий пользователя. Как правило, в реальных API поддерживается более глубокая вложенность.\n\nФильтрация с помощью параметров\nДо этого мы получали данные, используя уникальный ключ —&nbsp;числовой идентификатор ресурса. Но часто бывает нужно найти ресурс, имея только одну его характеристику. Это можно сделать с помощью запросов с параметрами (query-параметрами). Параметры указываются в URL после имени ресурса следующим образом: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/&lt;ресурс&gt; ? &lt;параметр&gt; = &lt;значение&gt;.\nИспользуем query-параметры для поиска всех незавершённых задач пользователя с userId=1. Для этого нужно указать completed=false для ресурса /todos:\n\nОтвет:\n\nПопробуйте воспользоваться знанием устройства API, чтобы найти следующее:\n\nВсе альбомы, принадлежащие пользователю с userId=5;\nВсе комментарии к посту с postId=73;\nЕдинственного пользователя, у которого email=Sincere@april.biz.\n\nPOST-запросы\nЗапросы этого типа используются для передачи данных. Напомню, что в JSONPlaceholder POST-запросы имитируются, ресурсы на самом деле не создаются, но ответ от сервера приходит точно такой, как при выполнении настоящих запросов.\nPOST-запросы в curl требуют указания большего количества параметров:\n\nМетод, указанный с помощью флага -X, после которого указывается URL ресурса;\nТип данных, указанный с помощью флага -H;\nТело запроса с помощью флага -d. Так как тип данных в данном случае это application/json, передаваемые данные должны быть в формате JSON.\n\nПопробуем создать новый пост, автором которого будет пользователь с userId=1:\n\nТак как в API уже есть 100 ресурсов такого типа, у нового поста id=101. Ответ в формате JSON:\n\nДалее создадим новый комментарий, отправленный пользователем с именем Иван к первому посту:\n\nОтвет:\n\nНапоследок создадим новую задачу:\n\nОтвет:\n\nНа этом заканчивается знакомство с основами HTTP-запросов.\nВ следующих статьях рассмотрим подробнее другие аспекты клиент-серверного взаимодействия.\n","description":"","id":"https://alexjameson.github.io/articles/http-api-quickstart/","path":"/articles/http-api-quickstart/","title":"Понимание веб-разработки: запросы к HTTP API"},"https://alexjameson.github.io/articles/localization/":{"body":"Форматирование влияет на восприятие и доверие к информации, особенно представленной в документации. Это простая вещь, но в ней есть нюансы.\nЦель этой статьи —&nbsp;дать простое и понятное объяснение процесса локализации чисел, валют и дат в переведенных или изначально написанных на английском текстах. В качестве примеров используется наиболее популярная локаль en-US, а в качестве валют —&nbsp;доллары (USD).\nДля веб-платформ существуют единые стандарты отображения данных:\n\n\nIntl API в браузерах и JavaScript (часть стандарта ECMAScript).\n\n\nUnicode CLDR (Common Locale Data Repository) - универсальный стандарт, лежащий в основе Intl API. Intl.NumberFormat, Intl.DateTimeFormat и другие компоненты этого API используют локализационные данные из Unicode CLDR.\n\n\nIntl поддерживается всеми современными браузерами и по умолчанию применяется для локализации контента. За счет использования данных из Unicode CLDR этот механизм также обеспечивает соответствие национальным стандартам —&nbsp;ISO, ГОСТ и прочим.\nИнтерактивный пример\nДля простоты при выборе локали предполагается, что в локали Ru валюта — это рубли, а в En —&nbsp;доллары. О некоторых особенностях форматирования валют в разных локалях рассказано далее.\n\n    \n        \n            Число\n            Валюта\n            Дата\n        \n        \n            Ru\n            En\n        \n    \n    \n        \n        \n    \n    Форматировать\n    \n\nКак форматировать числа, валюты и даты\nБудут рассмотрены локали ru-RU и en-US. Подробнее о числах и валютах см. CLDR: Number and currency patterns, о датах — CLDR: Date/Time Patterns.\nЧисла и валюты\n\nВ ru-RU используется запятая как разделитель дробной части и пробел для тысяч.\nВ en-US — точка для дробной части и запятая для тысяч.\nСимвол для обозначения валюты ставится перед числом без пробела в англоязычной среде, а в русскоязычной — после и с пробелом.\n\nКатегорияru-RUen-US\nЧисло1 234,5671,234.567\nРубли1 234,56 ₽₽1,234.56\nДоллары1 234,56 $$1,234.56\n\n\nВ локали en-US у абсолютного большинства валют символ валюты ставится перед числом.\nТаблица выше показывает общий случай. В других локалях или при наличии определенных требований, таких как национальный стандарт, позиция символа относительно числа может быть иной.\n\nДата\nКатегорияru-RUen-US\nДата06.07.20247/6/2024\nДата и время06.07.2024, 14:30:007/6/2024, 2:30:00 PM\nДата(строковый формат)6 июля 2024 г.July 6, 2024\n\nВ en-US:\n\nНули в начале числового кода дня и месяца пропускаются.\nОбязателен пробел между числом и AM/PM. 2:30 PM — правильно, 2:30PM — неправильно.\nДля большей точности в локализованных строках можно добавлять обозначения PDT (Pacific Daylight Time) и PST (Pacific Standard Time), являющиеся аналогами летнего и зимнего времени. PDT это часовой пояс UTC−7, PST — UTC-8. Мне никогда не приходилось применять их, но об их существовании полезно знать.\n\nРабота с датами: универсальный формат для хранения и передачи\nДля работы с API и в других случаях, когда нужно обеспечить машиночитаемость, не должны использоваться локализованные строки из примеров выше. Вместо них рекомендуется использовать даты, соответствующие ISO 8601 в UTC:\n\nРасшифровка:\nЧастьЗначениеПояснение\n2024ГодЧетырёхзначный год\n07МесяцИюль (всегда двузначный: 01–12)\n06День6-е число месяца (01–31)\n-РазделительСтатический разделитель года, месяца и дня\nTМаркер времениОбозначает начало временной части (от Time)\n14Часы14 часов в 24-часовом формате (2:30 PM)\n30Минуты30 минут\n00Секунды00 секунд\nZВременная зонаОбозначает UTC (Zero offset, нулевое смещение)\n\nПоследняя буква Z, обозначающая временную зону, применяется для указания времени по Гринвичу, то есть в часовом поясе UTC+0. В других временных зонах нужно явно указывать смещение в часах и минутах в форматах +HH:MM или -HH:MM.\nПримеры:\n\n2024-07-06T14:30:00Z — UTC+0 (Гринвич);\n2024-07-06T17:30:00+03:00 — то же самое время, но в часовом поясе Москвы (UTC+3);\n2024-07-06T07:30:00-07:00 — то же самое время, но в часовом поясе Нью-Йорка, Лос-Анжелеса или Торонто (UTC-7).\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://alexjameson.github.io/articles/localization/","path":"/articles/localization/","title":"Локализация чисел, валют и дат"},"https://alexjameson.github.io/articles/soft-and-hard-skills/":{"body":"В этой статье я постараюсь описать то, как я вижу набор навыков для профессионала в нашей отрасли. Можно рассматривать эту статью как чеклист, но ни в коем случае не как карту развития, матрицу компетенций или исчерпывающее руководство по профессии.\nВ этой статье речь идет о технических писателях, чьими непосредственными адресатами являются конечные пользователи программных продуктов. Я мало знаю о людях, занимающихся составлением проектной документации, не представляю себе процесс подготовки документов для ФСТЭК или Минцифры, никогда не работал с ГОСТ любых серий, и уже много лет не писал ничего для не технических пользователей.\nHard Skills и Soft Skills\nЯ бы сказал, что ключевое различие между этими навыками заключается в том, что hard skills можно развивать самостоятельно и оценивать их прогресс, а soft skills в первую очередь приобретаются с опытом. Курсы и другие способы  развития soft skills, конечно, существуют, но их значимость возрастает для специалистов старших грейдов.\nНо есть еще более важная деталь. В нашей профессии грань между hard и soft skills достаточно условна, потому что технический писатель описывает работу своих коллег. Для выполнения своих непосредственных обязанностей мы не можем не коммуницировать с людьми и не думать о циркуляции знаний в организации.\n\n\n\n\nМне не попадались хорошие переводы этих терминов. Я бы сказал, что hard skills —&nbsp;это технические навыки, особенно когда речь идет об инженерах и разработчиках. Это то, что нужно каждому отдельному специалисту для выполнения своей работы.\nSoft skills я бы перевел как социальные навыки. Эти навыки характеризуют работу в команде и социальное взаимодействие, и позволяют выполнять работу эффективнее.\nВ этой статье для простоты я оставлю англоязычные термины.\n\n\nHard Skills\nHard skills можно изучать, развивать и измерять прогресс во владении. Не обязательно знать их все, достаточно иметь о них представление, чтобы при случае быстро ими овладеть. Я выделяю 4 основные подгруппы:\nРабота с текстом\n\nГрамотное письмо (орфография, пунктуация, синтаксис);\nВладение разными стилями речи и умение выбирать подходящий стиль для задачи;\nСоблюдение стайлгайдов (внутренних и внешних);\nРедактура: проверка логики, структуры, терминологии;\nАдаптация текста под разные аудитории (новички, эксперты, специалисты разных направлений);\nПонимание топологии Diataxis и знание о других типах документов;\nСоздание шаблонов типовых документов.\n\n\nВладение предметной областью\nЧтобы писать о технологии, нужно понимать, какие задачи стоят перед пользователями, что они хотят сделать с помощью описываемого продукта. Далеко не для всех перечисленных ниже пунктов нужно иметь практический опыт, по большей части хватит уверенного владения теорией.\nНапомню, что я говорю в первую очередь о технических писателях, составляющих документацию для технических специалистов. Следующий список даст базовое понимание веб-разработки:\n\nБазовое понимание программирования на любом популярном языке. Моя рекомендация —&nbsp;Python, хотя первым языком у меня был JavaScript;\nРабота с API, в первую очередь понимание REST API, реализуемого с помощью протокола HTTP;\nПонимание клиент-серверного взаимодействия, различия бэкенда и фронтенда;\nПонимание работы сети, можно начать с концепций IP-адресов и DNS на базовом уровне и продолжать почти до бесконечности;\nОсновы СУБД;\nЗнакомство с Linux.\n\nПодробнее эти навыки и знания будут рассмотрены в отдельной статье.\n\nВладение инструментами технического писателя\nЯ считаю инструменты наименее важной частью компетенций технического писателя. При этом, они легче всего поддаются изучению и их любят указывать в вакансиях. Но я рекомендую не забывать о том, что технического писателя нанимают для донесения знаний до аудитории, а как именно это произойдет — как минимум вторично, пусть и с некоторыми оговорками.\n\nDocs as Code:\n\nСистемы контроля версий и связанные платформы — Git, GitHub, GitLab;\nГенераторы статических сайтов (SSG) —&nbsp;Docusaurus, MkDocs, Sphinx и другие;\nЯзыки разметки — Markdown, reStructuredText, AsciiDoc;\nГенерация документации к API —&nbsp;Swagger / OpenAPI;\nПрочие инструменты и утилиты, которые помогают работать с исходниками, например Pandoc.\n\n\nПлатформы для совместного ведения документации:\n\nConfluence;\nWiki-системы;\nИнструменты, подобные Notion или Gramax.\n\n\nОфисные инструменты:\n\nMicrosoft Word и Google docs.\n\n\nСоздание графического контента:\n\nОбработка скриншотов — Snagit, GIMP и другие по выбору;\nСхемы и диаграммы — Mermaid, PlantUML, draw.io, Figma.\n\n\nРабота с ИИ-инструментами.\nСейчас еще сложно выделить какие-то универсальные инструменты, подходящие для всех ситуаций.\nТипичные задачи —&nbsp;переписывание сложных формулировок, проверка текста и создание черновиков.\nВыбирайте модель под свои задачи, не забывая о безопасности.\n\n\nУправление знаниями\nУправление знаниями — это системный подход к тому, как информация появляется, хранится, обновляется и используется в организации. Этот навык частично попадает в категорию soft skills, так как получение и распространение знаний напрямую связано с общением с коллегами.\n\nПоиск и сбор знаний — выявление \"информационных островов\" (чаты, коммиты, внутренние-вики);\nСтруктурирование — создание шаблонов, категорий, меток, унификация представления;\nАктуализация — регулярная проверка и обновление контента в условиях работы с неполной и противоречивой информацией;\nОбеспечение доступности — размещение информации там, где ее можно найти;\nВладение информацией о процессах — понимание того, как устроен процесс разработки и релиза в команде.\n\n\nSoft Skills\nSoft skills — это личностные качества и поведенческие навыки. Я считаю, что они, во-первых, развиваются с опытом, а во-вторых, выводятся из нескольких простых принципов, например общаться с коллегами уважительно, работать над обратной связью, брать на себя ответственность и обеспечивать прозрачность.\nКоммуникация с экспертами\n\nУмение задавать точные, конкретные вопросы, чтобы получить нужную информацию;\nВыстраивание доверия с разработчиками, менеджерами, архитекторами и другими стейкхолдерами;\nАдаптация стиля общения под собеседника;\nВлияние на людей без формальных полномочий.\n\n\nПример:\nВместо \"Расскажите про API\" —\n\"Какие методы чаще всего используются? В каких случаях возвращается ошибка 403?\"\n\n\nЭмпатия к пользователям\n\nПонимание контекста использования;\nПредвидение вопросов и ошибок;\nБыть в мире пользователя (по Ильяхову);\nРаботать с обратной связью от пользователей в любой доступной форме.\n\n\nПример:\nДля DevOps: \"Передайте токен в заголовок Authorization\"\nДля бизнес-пользователя: \"Где найти токен и как его использовать\"\n\n\nОбщие профессиональные навыки\nНавыкКак проявляется\nПереговорыУмение договариваться о времени, приоритетах, формате ревью\nДеловое общениеЧеткие письма, запросы, отчеты. Без воды и с конкретной целью\nПланированиеУправление задачами, сроками, приоритетами. Работа с бэклогом\nОбратная связьУмение давать и принимать фидбэк в корректной форме\nЛичная эффективностьСпособность ориентироваться в организации, брать инициативу при наличии недостатков в документации,работать в условиях высокой неопределенности и частых изменений\n\n\nДополнительные навыки: зона роста\nЕсть несколько групп навыков, которые были бы полезны как hard skills технического писателя, но относятся к другим специальностям. Можно сказать, что такие навыки обеспечивают рост через T-shaping.\nДизайн и UX\nЧасто технический писатель — это последний человек внутри команды, который сможет посмотреть на продукт «глазами пользователя» и поработать с ним перед релизом.\n\nПостроение пути пользователя:\n\nКак пользователь приходит к решению?\nГде он теряется? Где ищет помощь?\n\n\nПроектирование структуры сайта документации:\n\nЛогичная структура контента;\nПравильная навигация;\nПоиск, фильтры, рекомендации.\n\n\nРабота с текстами интерфейса:\n\nПравильные тексты для кнопок, ошибок и подсказок;\nПонятные и унифицированные с документацией формулировки.\n\n\n\nТестирование\nТехнический писатель может и должен предоставлять актуальную и фактически достоверную документацию. Я бы отнес базовые навыки тестирования к необходимым, но для роста можно использовать профессиональные навыки ручных тестировщиков, например создание тестовых сценариев и оформление найденных ошибок в установленных форматах.\n\nРаботают ли примеры кода?\nМожно ли выполнить инструкцию шаг за шагом?\nГде пользователь может ошибиться?\nКакие шаги можно упростить?\n\n\nАналитика\nЧтобы понимать, насколько хорошо документация на самом деле решает задачи пользователей, имеет смысл посмотреть на реальные данные об этом.\n\nВеб-аналитика:\n\nGoogle Analytics, Яндекс Метрика;\nПопулярные страницы, время на странице, отказы;\nПоисковые запросы на сайте с документацией.\n\n\nМетрики качества:\n\nКоличество обращений в поддержку по теме;\nЧастота обновлений страницы;\nОтзывы пользователей.\n\n\n\n\n\nЕсли страница с высоким трафиком имеет 90% отказов — нужно улучшать структуру.\nЕсли в поиске часто ищут «ошибка 403» — добавить раздел с рекомендациями по исправлению ошибок.\nЕсли страница редко обновляется, но много читают — проверить актуальность.\n\n\n\nDocOps\nDocOps — это DevOps для документации. Это обеспечение надежности, скорости работы и расширение возможностей инструментов.\n\nАвтоматизация проверок:\n\nОрфография — с помощью Cspell или Vale;\nФорматирование — Prettier, Markdownlint;\nПроверка битых ссылок.\n\n\nИнтеграция в CI/CD:\n\nСборка документации при каждом коммите;\nПроверка на наличие ключевых элементов.\n\n\nСобственные плагины, скрипты и инструменты, от сниппетов в любимом редакторе до расширений существующих генераторов.\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://alexjameson.github.io/articles/soft-and-hard-skills/","path":"/articles/soft-and-hard-skills/","title":"Навыки технического писателя"},"https://alexjameson.github.io/articles/ssg-comparison/":{"body":"Цель сравнения — помочь людям, которые не слишком хорошо себе знакомы с различными генераторами статических сайтов, составить базовое представление о нескольких распространенных решениях. Обзор не претендует на объективность и показывает в первую очередь мой опыт.\nЯ сравнил генераторы по нескольким параметрам, которые кажутся мне достаточно важными и при этом доступными для анализа, но получившиеся результаты довольно субъективны. Причина в том, что я сам работаю в Яндексе и последние 4 года я пишу документацию с помощью Diplodoc. Это ведет к тому, что у меня самый актуальный и глубокий опыт именно с этим инструментом, а еще он мне просто нравится.\nРезультаты могут очень сильно различаться в зависимости от сценариев использования, для простоты я предполагаю, что мы сравниваем генераторы для небольшого документационного проекта объемом в пару десятков уже имеющихся Markdown-файлов. В этом обзоре не затронуты инструменты для AsciiDoc и других языков (за исключением Sphinx) так как у меня нет практического опыта работы с ними. Также я не рассмотрел самый популярный на GitHub генератор статических сайтов на основе Markdown под названием Gatsby, так как он давно стал фактически фреймворком для создания веб-приложений, а также потому, что я не следил за его развитием в последние годы и не ориентируюсь в существующих пяти версиях.\nБазовое сравнение\nМожно выбрать любой из этих генераторов, все они обладают возможностями, которые позволяют делать удобные и кастомизируемые сайты. Везде сейчас есть поддержка диаграмм как кода, переиспользование контента, возможность встраивать генерацию по стандарту OpenAPI и многое другое.\nОсновные различия заключаются в наличии некоторых дополнительных возможностей, сложности конфигурации и эксплуатации.\nTl;dr\n\nDocusaurus отлично подходит для любых проектов, позволяет добавить интерактивность и кастомизировать что угодно при знании React.\nMkDocs идеален для быстрого старта и простых проектов, широко распространен в индустрии.\nDiplodoc подходит для крупных и средних проектов, активно развивается. Единственный генератор в списке с изначально русскоязычным сообществом.\nSphinx это сложный инструмент. Нужно быть готовым разбираться во множестве вещей, зато можно сделать практически что угодно.\nHugo выделяется скоростью и производительностью, подойдет для самых разных проектов — от блогов до больших порталов.\nJekyll остаётся неплохим выбором для практически любых проектов из-за долгой истории, множества плагинов и простоты использования, но постепенно теряет популярность.\n\nСравнение характеристик\nКритерийDocusaurusMkDocsDiplodocSphinxHugoJekyll\nСкоростьБыстроОчень быстроСреднеДолгоСреднеБыстро\nСложность использованияСредняяНизкаяСредняяВысокаяСредняяНизкая\nДокументация и сообществоОтличноОтличноСреднеОтличноХорошоОтлично\nЭкосистемаМного плагинов, MDXMaterial theme, макросыПлагины, совместимые с markdown-itЕсть всеОбширная стандартная библиотека, плагиныПлагины\nГенерация OpenAPIВстроенная поддержка, плагиныПлагиныВстроенная поддержка, без кастомизацииБольше всего вариантовПлагины, стандартные средстваПлагины, стандартные средства\n\nПодробный разбор\nDocusaurus\nРазработчик и дата выпуска: Meta (Facebook), 2017 год | Сайт\n\nЯзык: JavaScript\nСложность использования: Средняя. Для базового использования достаточно знания Markdown, для кастомизации нужны знания React.\nДокументация и сообщество: Отличная документация, большое активное сообщество, множество примеров.\nЛокализация и версионирование: Встроенная поддержка.\nЭкосистема: Богатая. Поддержка MDX, множество плагинов, темы.\nПереиспользование контента: MDX компоненты.\nOpenAPI: Интеграция с Redocly, Redoc, поддержка Swagger UI, Docusaurus OpenAPI Plugin.\nПоиск: Встроенный локальный поиск + интеграция с Algolia DocSearch.\nПример сайта: ClickHouse.\n\nМое мнение:\nПрекрасный инструмент, который сочетает в себе простоту и в то же время возможности для создания прекрасных сайтов. Есть возможность быстро начать использовать, добавив все необходимое для комфортного использования документации просто прописав несколько строк в конфигурационном файле — работающий поиск, простая локализация, версионирование, понятные плагины и многое другое.\nВажнейшая часть для кастомизации — MDX. Это формат, который позволяет совмещать Markdown и JSX в одном файле и таким образом создавать любые сочетания текста и интерактивных элементов, в том числе используя переменные, условный рендеринг и возможности компонентного подхода.\nЭтот инструмент также хорошо подходит для создания целых сайтов, в которых документация — только один из разделов, и в таком случае получится сохранить единый стиль для всех частей продукта, причем этот стиль будет проработан фронтендерами с помощью привычных подходов.\nMkDocs\nРазработчик и дата выпуска: Tom Christie, 2014 год | Сайт\n\nЯзык: Python\nСложность использования: Низкая. Чистый Markdown с возможностью расширения через плагины, простая конфигурация в YAML.\nДокументация и сообщество: Хорошая документация, активное сообщество.\nЛокализация и версионирование: Через плагины.\nЭкосистема: Material theme значительно расширяет функциональность инструмента, множество плагинов.\nПереиспользование контента: Макросы.\nOpenAPI: Через плагины (swagger-ui).\nПоиск: Встроенный поиск в Material theme.\nПример сайта: Видеонаблюдение Ростелеком.\n\nМое мнение:\nГоворим MkDocs — чаще всего подразумеваем тему или фреймворк Material for MkDocs, я уже давно не видел проектов только на MkDocs без Material. В своей основе MkDocs это предельно простой генератор, я бы даже рискнул назвать его примитивным. А Material for MkDocs расширяет его функциональность, добавляя умный поиск, продвинутое форматирование, разные визуальные элементы вроде вкладок и аннотаций, поддержку диаграмм как кода и так далее.\nЯ использовал его для прототипирования сайта с документацией для одного из проектов по работе, и мне понадобилось меньше получаса чтобы показать уже собранный и готовый к выкладке сайт с несколькими страницами документации. Это быстро, понятно и довольно удобно, но в то же время не все готовы мириться с тем, как выглядит готовый сайт, и что кастомизировать его будет непросто.\nDiplodoc\nРазработчик и дата выпуска: Яндекс, 2022 год | Сайт\n\nЯзык: JavaScript\nВремя развертывания: 30-45 минут.\nСложность использования: Средняя. Своя система шаблонов и форматирования.\nДокументация и сообщество: Базовая документация, небольшое русскоязычное сообщество.\nПоддержка диаграмм: Встроенная поддержка (Mermaid).\nЛокализация и версионирование: Нужно описывать конфигурацию самостоятельно, но поддержка в планах.\nЭкосистема: Любые плагины, совместимые с парсером markdown-it. Самому с этим справиться непросто.\nПереиспользование контента: Встроенный механизм на нескольких уровнях, от блоков до целых страниц.\nOpenAPI: Встроенная поддержка, включая плейграунд.\nПоиск: Интеграция с Lunr.\nПример сайта: YDB Docs.\n\nМое мнение:\nЭто хороший инструмент, который сделан в первую очередь для средних и крупных проектов. В основе работы с Markdown - свой диалект (YFM), который даёт больше возможностей, чем практически у всех остальных инструментов в этом списке.\nПомимо обычных статических страниц, можно декларативно описывать кастомные страницы (например разводящие страницы) с помощью Page Constructor. Технический писатель может делать это самостоятельно, и эти страницы будут выглядеть действительно хорошо, как в этом примере.\nДля крупных проектов у этого инструмента есть некоторые особые возможности, например пресеты переменных, которые позволяют легко генерировать из одной текстовой базы несколько разных версий документации, а также хорошая производительность, которая позволяет собирать сайты из репозиториев объемом даже в пару гигабайт, знаю по своему опыту.\nDiplodoc — это определенно не самый просто инструмент для самостоятельной настройки. Я знаю технических писателей, которые успешно с этим справляются и даже создают полноценные пайплайны для CI/CD, но не все могут это сделать.\nSphinx\nРазработчик и дата выпуска: Georg Brandl для Python Software Foundation, 2008 год | Сайт\n\nЯзык: Python\nСложность использования: Высокая. Использует reStructuredText (хотя поддерживает и Markdown), сложная конфигурация.\nДокументация и сообщество: Обширная документация, большое устоявшееся сообщество.\nЛокализация и версионирование: Встроенная поддержка обеих функций, продвинутые инструменты для перевода.\nЭкосистема: Богатейшая экосистема расширений.\nПереиспользование контента: Продвинутая система директив.\nOpenAPI: Через расширения, множество способов.\nПоиск: Встроенный поиск, возможность интеграции с внешними системами.\nДополнительные преимущества:\n\nПревосходная поддержка LaTeX и PDF\nАвтоматическая генерация документации из кода (Docstrings)\nКросс-референсы между проектами\nСемантическая разметка\n\n\nПример сайта: Linux Kernel.\n\nМое мнение:\nSphinx — это самый зрелый и гибкий инструмент в списке, с помощью которого можно решить практически любую задачу. С другой стороны, процесс решения точно не будет простым — у этого инструмента очень крутая кривая обучения. Однако, это окупается впоследствии, если он оказывается в руках человека или команды, обладающих достаточными техническими навыками.\nSpinx появился как инструмент для документирования кода на Python, но давно вышел за пределы экосистемы и получил множество новых применений. В отличие от остальных инструментов, он позволяет работать как с Markdown, так и с reStructuredText, для которого был изначально создан. Markdown обрабатывается с помощью MyST-Parser, что позволяет еще и выбрать, какие элементы как нужно обрабатывать.\nТакже Sphinx из коробки позволяет автоматически генерировать документацию из комментариев в коде, причем с помощью разных стилей таких комментариев. А еще поддерживает LaTeX, экспорт в PDF, множество разных способов отображения справочников, API, возможность включать фрагменты кода из других проектов...\nВ общем, Sphinx подойдет для любых возможных задач для любых крупных и средних проектов, но для проектов меньших масштабов или при отсутствии людей, которые в состоянии справиться с его сложностью, он может принести немало головной боли.\nHugo\nРазработчик и дата выпуска: Steve Francia, 2013 год | Сайт\n\nЯзык: Go\nСложность использования: Средняя. Требует понимания Go templates для кастомизации.\nДокументация и сообщество: Подробная документация, активное сообщество.\nЛокализация и версионирование: Встроенная многоязычность, версионирование через ветки.\nЭкосистема: Множество тем и shortcodes.\nПереиспользование контента: Partial templates, shortcodes.\nOpenAPI: Через внешние инструменты и shortcodes.\nПоиск: Через интеграции (Algolia, Lunr).\nДополнительные преимущества:\n\nСамая быстрая сборка среди SSG\nОтличная производительность сайтов\n\n\nПример сайта: Ozon Docs\n\nМое мнение:\nHugo лично у меня вызвал противоречивые чувства. Для работы он требует установки Go, а потом позволяет собирать сайты с помощью крошечного бинарника без внешних зависимостей — просто и элегантно. Скорость работы потрясающая, а с самого начала получается сделать красивый сайт стандартными средствами, в сам инструмент уже встроено практически все, что нужно для работы. Есть и свой парсер Markdown — Goldenmark, и shortcodes, с помощью которых можно легко переиспользовать контент и прочие атрибуты инструмента, который считается стандартом индустрии.\nНо потом начинаются сложности, которые не дали мне как следует поисследовать Hugo в свободное время. После первых шагов хочется изучить возможности для кастомизации. Их у Hugo не просто много, а очень много. Вместо shortcodes можно использовать Partial templates, что требует понимания работы темплейтов в Go. Если темплейты Liquid (Jekyll, у Diplodoc аналогичный синтаксис) или Jinja2 мне оказались вполне понятны, то осмыслить темплейты в Go я так и не смог, хотя несколько раз пытался. Дальше появляются какие-то таксономии, функции, ресурсы страниц, хуки, модули и другие элементы.\nМне приходится поверить на слово, что это отличный инструмент. Мне понравился тестовый проект, но я сомневаюсь, что без разработчиков, владеющих Go, его можно без проблем использовать в продакшене.\nJekyll\nРазработчик и дата выпуска: Tom Preston-Werner (GitHub), 2008 год | Сайт\n\nЯзык: Ruby\nСложность использования: Низкая для базового использования, средняя для кастомизации.\nДокументация и сообщество: Хорошая документация, большое устоявшееся сообщество.\nЛокализация и версионирование: Базовая поддержка.\nЭкосистема: Множество плагинов и тем, особенно для блогов.\nПереиспользование контента: Includes, layouts.\nOpenAPI: Через плагины и интеграции.\nПоиск: Через плагины (Lunr, Algolia).\nДополнительные преимущества:\n\nНативная интеграция с GitHub Pages\nПростота использования\nБольшое количество готовых тем\n\n\nПример сайта: Deckhouse\n\nМое мнение:\nЭто был первый генератор статических сайтов, который я попробовал использовать, причем сделал это я еще до того как официально стал техническим писателем. В то время Ruby on Rails еще не вызывал удивления, и я с удовольствием поставил его себе в систему, ознакомился с концепцией Gems и сделал свой первый статический сайт (вроде бы блог). Не то чтобы это было просто, но результат мне вполне понравился.\nJekyll создавался в комьюнити Ruby, практически одновременно с GitHub, и они всегда были тесно связаны. Вы ведь наверняка неоднократно указывали .nojekyll при развертывании на GitHub Pages, правда? В те времена люди умели писать простую и понятную документацию, и руководства по Jekyll до сих пор остаются для меня примером.\nЗа годы присутствия на рынке Jekyll популяризовал то, что потом использовалось в десятках других генераторов — Front Matter, шаблоны Liquid, includes и многое другое. Отличительной чертой Jekyll всегда была простота, которая до сих пор впечатляет, а наработки сообщества предлагают широкий выбор для кастомизации сайта.\nСейчас Jekyll редко является очевидным выбором для новых проектов. Он фактически прекратил развиваться, а сам Ruby из модного языка с крупным сообществом стал скорее экзотикой. Появились новые подходы и новые инструменты, предлагающие другие возможности, но классика всегда останется классикой.\n","description":"","id":"https://alexjameson.github.io/articles/ssg-comparison/","path":"/articles/ssg-comparison/","title":"Сравнение генераторов статических сайтов для создания документации"},"https://alexjameson.github.io/articles/using-devtools/":{"body":"Это вторая статья из серии, посвящённой пониманию веб-разработки. В серии три статьи, в которых разбирается следующее:\n\nУвидим, как устроено клиент-серверное взаимодействие;\n→ Понаблюдаем за тем, как браузер получает и отображает данные, а также изучим структуру веб-страниц;\nРазвернем собственный локальный сервер, чтобы почувствовать, как работает веб изнутри.\n\nВ этой части мы перейдём на сторону клиента, который отображает данные, полученные с сервера. В предыдущей части мы уже использовали утилиту curl, которая выступала в роли клиента, а в роли сервера был сервис JSONPlaceholder. Сейчас в роли клиента будет выступать обычный браузер, с помощью которого вы читаете эту статью.\nКак правило, для объяснения работы браузера используются примеры разметки на HTML, стилей CSS и кода на JavaScript, но в этой статье упор сделан на понимание механизма отображения данных, так что эти технологии будут рассмотрены вскользь.\nДля анализа отображаемого контента и запросов к серверу будем использовать инструменты разработчика, которые в этой статье я называю DevTools. Это невероятно мощный набор инструментов, который встроен в каждый браузер.\n\nПодробнее:\n\nБаза по вёрстке: основы HTML\nБаза по вёрстке: основы CSS\n\n\nКак браузер отображает данные с сервера\nВ качестве клиента не обязательно используется браузер, это может быть другой сервер или, например, мобильное приложение. В этой статье мы рассмотрим браузер для наглядности.\nПолучение и отображение данных в браузере —&nbsp;многоступенчатый процесс. Если коротко, то этапы примерно следующие:\n\nВвод URL и запрос по этому адресу;\nСетевое взаимодействие: преобразование URL в IP-адрес с помощью DNS;\nУстановка соединения по HTTP(s);\nПолучение контента в HTML, JSON или в других форматах;\nПостроение DOM-дерева.\nРасчет положение элементов и применение CSS;\nОтрисовка;\nПрименение JavaScript.\n\nВсе эти этапы можно изучить с помощью DevTools, а получившийся результат можно с помощью них же модифицировать.\n\nПодробнее:\n\nЧто происходит, когда мы открываем сайт в браузере\n\n\nЧто такое DevTools\nDevTools (инструменты разработчика) —&nbsp;это встроенные в браузер средства для анализа и отладки веб-страниц. Их возможности включают, но не ограничиваются следующим:\n\nИзучение HTML-структуры и стилей CSS;\nИсполнение кода на JavaScript;\nОтображение ошибок;\nАнализ производительности;\nОтображение сетевых запросов и ресурсов;\nРазличные способы отладки и тестирования.\n\nDevTools есть практически в каждом современном браузере и их можно использовать в любой момент. В браузерах, которые основаны на Chromium (Chrome, Edge, Яндекс Браузер и большая часть остальных), инструменты разработчика везде одинаковые. Немного иная функциональность у таких инструментов в браузерах на движке Gecko, в первую очередь&nbsp;Firefox и его форках. Браузер Safari использует движок Webkit, и его инструменты разработчика оптимизированы для работы на устройствах Apple.\nРазличия между этими группами касаются нюансов, которые могут важны для фронтенд-разработчиков, но основная функциональность у них идентична.\nЗапускаем Devtools\nВ примерах ниже будут показаны инструменты разработчика в Яндекс Браузере на MacBook.\nЧтобы открыть панель DevTools, в окне с этой статьёй нажмите F12 или правую кнопку мыши → Просмотреть код (Inspect element). Вы увидите примерно следующее:\n\nКак запросить данные через DevTools и отобразить на странице\nРассмотрим, как браузер загружает данные и как можно вручную управлять контентом с помощью инструментов разработчика. В результате выполнения приведённого ниже скрипта пустое текстовое поле будет заполнено данными, полученными от JSONPlaceholder.\n\n\n\n  \n  JSON Viewer\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nОткройте DevTools на вкладке Console. При первом запуске может потребоваться подтверждение для исполнения произвольного кода.\n\n\nВ консоли вставьте следующий код:\n\n\n\nПосмотрите на текстовое поле, которое до этого было пустым.\n\n\nКак это работает\nКонсоль в инструментах разработчика позволяет запускать практически любой код на JavaScript.\nВыше приведен пример кода, который получает данные с удаленного сервера и отображает их на странице в указанном месте.\n\nfetch(...) — это стандартный для JavaScript HTTP-клиент, аналогичный разобранному в предыдущей статье curl, но работающий в другой среде. В этом примере используется GET-запрос по адресу https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1.\n.then(...) —&nbsp;это Promise, механизм, позволяющий создавать цепочки асинхронных последовательных операций.\ndocument.getElementById(...); — метод поиска в DOM и выставление значения на основе полученного JSON.\n.catch(error =&gt; { ... }) —&nbsp;обработчик ошибок.\n\nЧто ещё можно сделать\nDevTools предоставляет обширные возможности для анализа и профилирования веб-страниц, но я хотел бы сосредоточиться на тех, которые полезны специалистам, не занимающимся непосредственно разработкой.\nИзучение элементов\nНа вкладке Elements вы можете посмотреть страницу в виду HTML и изучить стили, применяемые к каждому элементу. Но этим возможности не ограничиваются —&nbsp;вы можете также заменить любой из этих элементов —&nbsp;переписать текст, добавить HTML-тег или модифицировать стили на любом уровне. Результат будет виден сразу, но после перезагрузки страницы изменения исчезнут.\nЭтот механизм позволяет в простых сценариях протестировать возможные изменения или сделать правильный макет для демонстрации, а разработчики могут изучить более глубокую структуру DOM-элементов.\n\nОтслеживание источников загружаемого контента\nВкладка Sources содержит информацию обо всем контенте страницы, который загружается из различных источников. Загружается сама страница в виде HTML, CSS, JavaScript, изображения, шрифты и многое другое. Как можно увидеть на скриншоте, большая часть контента моего сайта идет из одного источника.\n\nРабота с сетью\nВкладка Network позволяет изучить все сетевые запросы, которые делает браузер при работе со страницей. Такие возможности сложно переоценить при тестировании веб-приложений. На этой вкладке можно фильтровать запросы по типу или названия, чтобы изучить их.\nЧасто я комбинирую самостоятельное изучение запросов с записью HAR-файлов при тестировании и отладке. Эти файлы содержат список всех сетевых запросов в ходе работы со страницей, чтобы передать эти записи команде разработки вместе с текстовым описанием моих действий. Чтобы включить запись, нажмите 🔴 в левом верхнем углу панели DevTools.\n\nНа скриншоте выше показаны все запросы, которые были отправлены на момент отображения страницы, статус, инициатор, объем переданных данных и время выполнения. В нижней строке видно, что на локальном сервере отрисовка страницы потребовала 337 миллисекунд, было передано 3.1 мегабайт данных в ходе 20 запросов. Наибольшую часть объёма составляют PNG-файлы, то есть изображения, а также шрифты (TTF). А если проанализировать статью про навыки технического писателя, то можно видеть, что большая часть объема той страницы приходится на файлы библиотеки mermaid.js, которую я использую для создания диаграмм.\nКаждый запрос можно изучить детальнее. Кликните на любой запрос в списке и откроется панель с деталями:\n\n\nКонечно, это не все возможности, которые предоставляют DevTools для анализа и отладки веб-страниц и приложений. Они позволяют сделать намного больше: эмулировать устройства разных видов, устанавливать скорость соединения, запускать запись всех действий на странице, изучать доступность контента и много другое, но это выходит за рамки статьи-знакомства. Даже пользуясь базовыми механизмами, описанными в этой статье, уже можно радикально повысить эффективность своей работы и получить более глубокое понимание клиентской части веб-разработки.\n","description":"Изучаем обработку данных на стороне клиента и инструменты разработчика в браузере","id":"https://alexjameson.github.io/articles/using-devtools/","path":"/articles/using-devtools/","title":"Понимание веб-разработки: клиентская часть и DevTools"},"https://alexjameson.github.io/mentorship/":{"body":"Менторство\nДелюсь опытом, даю советы и разбираю различные случаи.
