Use cloud networks to transmit information between cloud resources and connect them.

Note that a list of [networks](../concepts/networks.md) in DoubleCloud is created automatically when you allocate a resource in a network. You can select a network when you create ClickHouse and Apache KafkaÂ® clusters in DoubleCloud.

## See the list of networks {#manage-networks}

1. Go to the [console](https://app.double.cloud).
