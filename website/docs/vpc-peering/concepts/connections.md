DoubleCloud VPC allows you to create peering connections between your own VPC and another managed network.

:::caution

Currently, only connections to AWS networks are supported.

You can see a list of your networks in the [management console](https://app.double.cloud) if you open the **VPC** service on the **Connections** tab. Each connection on this tab has the following properties:

* **Network status**

* Creation **date and time**

* Your **network** being connected

* Information about the peered network:

   * **Provider**

   * **IPv4 CIDR**

   * **IPv6 CIDR**

   * Provider network **ID**

   * Provider **Region**

   * Provider **Account**

* **Managed IPv4 CIDR**

* **Managed IPv6 CIDR**

* **Peering Connection ID**
